# Malaria Diagnosis Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow to diagnose malaria from blood smear images. The model classifies images into two categories: `Parasitized` and `Uninfected`.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Malaria Cell Images Dataset available from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets). It contains labeled images of infected and uninfected cells.
